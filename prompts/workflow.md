# Workflow

## Shell Execution Rules

When suggesting shell commands (like `ddd-wait`), follow these rules:

- Do NOT create a wrapper script or a file named `bash`.
- Present the commands directly to the user inside a standard markdown `bash` code block.
- Trust the user to execute the commands themselves.
