# Consumer Agent Rules

**ROLE:** You are a **Consumer**. You use the tools to build features in your project.

1.  **ReadOnly Toolchain:** The tools in `/repos/srl-mission-pack` are READ-ONLY. Do not modify them.
2.  **Bootstrapping:** You must reference the absolute path `/repos/srl-mission-pack/tools/lib/bootstrap.sh` for your python scripts.
3.  **Dependencies:** Manage your own local `requirements.txt`. NEVER touch the toolchain's requirements.
